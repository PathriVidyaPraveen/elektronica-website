summary: Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is the specification of the interaction between a low level program and the hardware. The Hardware designer has to come up with a microarchitecture to implement the ISA on a chip.
description: SPARC (Scalable Processor ARChitecture) is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) ISA developed by Sun Microsystems. A RISC ISA uses simple instructions that execute quickly with simpler hardware. SPARC has been used in many military and enterprise sectors. For example, the S-400 land-to-air missileâ€™s control system, Elbrus-90, oversees the phased array radar antenna and allows detection in range of 600 kilometres. The Elbrus-90 computer houses a microprocessor made by MCST which is based on the SPARC ISA. Press enter or click to view image in full size
