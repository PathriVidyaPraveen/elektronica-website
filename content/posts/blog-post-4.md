summary: The word AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) is widespread in the modern world. People can learn about the various events that occur around the world through AI. AI is omnipresent. In this article, we will delve into AI-powered hearing aids, with a primary focus on their signal processing capabilities.
description: As people age, many tend to experience a decline in their hearing ability due to physical or genetic reasons. The hearing aid is a device that helps people regain auditory ability. Todayâ€™s hearing aids are smaller, yet they are more powerful than ever before. How exactly does a hearing aid work ? Well, it consists of four main components, namely the microphone, amplifier, speaker, and battery. The microphone picks up sound waves and converts these into digital signals that are then sent to an amplifier. The amplifier works by increasing the strength of the digital signals and sending them to the speaker. The speaker then produces amplified sound to the ear. Tiny hair cells called stereocilia present inside the cochlea ( inner ear ) detect vibrations, convert them into electrical signals that the brain processes as sound. Hearing aids are, in turn, powered by batteries, either disposable or rechargeable, depending upon the model. In addition to all these, there can be secondary components like volume control, ear hook, earmold, vent ( to prevent infections and for ventilation ), and wax guard ( keeps the instrument away from wax ).
